Getting and Cleaning Data - coursera course - Project

All information regarding received data, please find into README.txt and features_info.txt files. This document assumes that you are familiar with those files. After it, also take a look at README.md where you can find more information on how data was cleaned in this project.

Final clean data, ready for further analysis you can find in FinalMean.txt file. First row represents names of columns. Names are derived and similar to names in features_info.txt and features.txt, so take a look into those documents.

Data shown in FinalMean.txt represents average of measured data per person and per activity. Therefore, it has 120 rows (30 subjects - people * 6 activity types) and 71 columns (activityType, subject(id of subject) and 69 averages of received measures (not all measures were taken, but just means and standard deviations)).

Information on columns:

- "activityType": One of the actiities subjec (person) performed (possible values: Walking, WalkingUp (Walking Upstairs), WalkingDown (Walking downstairs), Sitting, Standing, Laying)
- "subject": id of person performing activity (can go between 1 and 30) 
- "tBodyAccMeanX" "tBodyAccMeanY" "tBodyAccMeanZ" "tBodyAccStdX" "tBodyAccStdY" "tBodyAccStdZ" "tGravityAccMeanX" "tGravityAccMeanY" "tGravityAccMeanZ" "tGravityAccStdX" "tGravityAccStdY" "tGravityAccStdZ" "tBodyAccJerkMeanX" "tBodyAccJerkMeanY" "tBodyAccJerkMeanZ" "tBodyAccJerkStdX" "tBodyAccJerkStdY" "tBodyAccJerkStdZ" "tBodyGyroMeanX" "tBodyGyroMeanY" "tBodyGyroMeanZ" "tBodyGyroStdX" "tBodyGyroStdY" "tBodyGyroStdZ" "tBodyGyroJerkMeanX" "tBodyGyroJerkMeanY" "tBodyGyroJerkMeanZ" "tBodyGyroJerkStdX" "tBodyGyroJerkStdY" "tBodyGyroJerkStdZ" "tBodyAccMagMean" "tBodyAccMagStd" "tGravityAccMagMean" "tGravityAccMagStd" "tBodyAccJerkMagMean" "tBodyAccJerkMagStd" "tBodyGyroMagMean" "tBodyGeroMagStd" "tBodyGyroJerkMagMean" "tBodyGyroJerkMagStd" "fBodyAccMeanX" "fBodyAccMeanY" "fBodyAccMeanZ" "fBodyAccStdX" "fBodyAccStdY" "fBodyAccStdZ" "fBodyAccJerkMeanX" "fBodyAccJerkMeanY" "fBodyAccJerkMeanZ" "fBodyAccJerkStdX" "fBodyAccJerkStdY" "fBodyAccJerkStdZ" "fBodyAccJerkMeanFreqX" "fBodyAccJerkMeanFreqY" "fBodyAccJerkMeanFreqZ" "fBodyGyroMeanX" "fBodyGyroMeanY" "fBodyGyroMeanZ" "fBodyGyroStdX" "fBodyGyroStdY" "fBodyGyroStdZ" "fBodyAccMagMean" "fBodyAccMagStd" "fBodyAccJerkMagMean" "fBodyAccJerkMagStd" "fBodyBodyGyroMagMean" "fBodyBodyGyroMagStd" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagMean" "fBodyGyroJerkMagStd": 69 different measures taken from Human activity research (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). All data are averages of measures per person and activityType. All data are in range [-1,1]. For the meaning of names, please check files: features_info.txt and features.txt
